<p><strong>Acolytes,</strong> youth grades seven through twelve, assist in the worship service by lighting the candles, presenting the cross, collecting the offering, and distributing glasses during the celebration of Holy Communion.</p>
<p>The <strong>Altar Guild</strong> cares for and prepares the altar area, paraments, candles, flowers, Communion ware, Communion bread and wine, pew card racks, holiday decorations, and baptismal napkins.  This preparation is made on Saturday, by teams of members who serve for one month a year.  Communion ware is washed after services where Communion is celebrated.  Altar Guild also delivers the altar flowers after Sunday services to homebound members.</p>
<p><strong>Audio and Videotape Ministry</strong> volunteers videotape and tape record Sunday morning services and make duplicates of the tapes for delivery to those unable to attend services.</p>
<p><strong>Homebound Flower Delivery</strong> volunteers deliver altar flowers to homebound church members, usually on the day after a holiday.</p>
<p><strong>Lay Readers</strong> read the First and Second Lessons during the worship services.</p>
<p><strong>Ushers</strong> welcome and assist worshippers, pass out bulletins, take a count of worshippers, and occasionally assist in collecting the offering.</p>
